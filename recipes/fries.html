        <h2>How to make French Fries</h2>
           
          <ol>
            <li>Cut the potatoes into matchsticks, either with a knife or with a french fry cutter. The potato pieces should all be similar in size.</li>
            <li>Place the potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Soak the potatoes for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the water from the potatoes. Place the potatoes on a layer of paper towels and pat thoroughly with additional towels until dry.</li>
            <li>Place about 1/3 of the potatoes in the pot, and cook until tender. This takes about 4-5 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat of the oil to 400 degrees F. Place 1/3 of the potatoes back in the pot and cook for an additional 1-3 minutes or until golden brown. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes. Place the cooked potatoes on a sheet pan lined with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste over the fries. Add parsley if desired, then serve immediately.</li>

          </ol>
